Using a combination of dash components, pandas and other libraries to create machine learning web dashboard
I am using spyder IDE that comes in anaconda and python 3.8 to build a ML web dashboard. I used dash bootstrap library to make the layout, dash core components for complex functions like dropdowns and input, I used a csv dataframe which I uploaded using pandas pandas and the graphs are made using plotly express by plotly dash. The code works fine but I am having trouble installing callbacks and dash extension libraries so I am kinda stuck at the moment. Anyone can try helping ðŸ˜ƒ
